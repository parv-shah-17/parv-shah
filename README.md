Python Dev | Web Designer | Exploring Cyber Security (VAPT & Digital Forensics) | Aspiring Tech Entrepreneur | BCA Cyber Security @ SDJ | CSE Minor @ IIT Mandi.

I’m a Python Developer and Web Designer with a deep passion for Cyber Security and a strong ambition to build impactful Tech Startups. Currently pursuing my BCA in Cyber Security at SDJ International College, Surat, along with a Minor in CSE in Software Development from IIT Mandi, I’m laying the foundation to turn my passion into real-world solutions.

🔐 I’m especially fascinated by Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT) and Digital Forensics, and I’m actively learning how these disciplines play a crucial role in building secure digital products. For me, Cyber Security is not just a field—it's a mission to protect innovation and integrity in the tech world.

💡 My startup mindset pushes me to think beyond the code — to solve real problems through technology. I believe in building user-centric, secure, and scalable solutions that can grow into meaningful businesses. This mindset was sharpened during my Young Innovator Internship Challenge at Scaler School of Technology, where I gained hands-on exposure to Personal Branding, Digital Marketing, and UI/UX Design.

💻 I enjoy working with Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Excel, and I have a creative side expressed through Graphic Design. Whether it’s designing intuitive web interfaces or scripting backend logic, I love turning ideas into tangible results.

📈 I'm driven by a vision: to build the next generation of secure tech startups. If you're passionate about Cyber Security, startups, or innovative tech — let’s connect and build something meaningful together.
